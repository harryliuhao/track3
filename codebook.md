The final data set output include 81 variables
The first two variables are keys:
id: this is the identifier of the subjects. There are total 30 subjects.
activities: There are 6 types of activities. (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

The remaining 79 variables are the average of mean(): Mean value and std(): Standard deviation of the following signals. 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
